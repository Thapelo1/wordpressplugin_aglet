NOT REQUIRED:
You do not have to fulfill this part of the brief it is only a further test to see your skill level.
Although not required, it could earn you some serious brownie points!
1. Integrate your plugin so that it works with the Visual Composer plugin
or
2. Integrate your plugin so that it works with the Visual Composer plugin  as well as  the Ultimate Addons extension. Ultimate Addons already has Interactive Banners ( https://ultimate.brainstormforce.com/interactive-banner-2/ ) which could require only some custom tweaking.  Aglet’s Two Cents... we’d most probably look at Style 4 ;)
